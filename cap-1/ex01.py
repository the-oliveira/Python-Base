###Instructions
#Create a variable savings with the value of 100.
#Check out this variable by typing print(savings) in the script.

savings = 100
print(savings)


#Create a variable monthly_savings, equal to 10 and num_months, equal to 4.
#Multiply monthly_savings by num_months and save it to new_savings.
#Add new_savings to savings, saving the sum as total_savings.
#Print the value of total_savings.

monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings

# Print total_savings
print(total_savings)

#Calculate the product of monthly_savings and num_months. Store the result in year_savings.
#What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year_savings.
#Calculate the sum of intro and intro and store the result in a new variable doubleintro.
#Print out doubleintro. Did you expect this?

monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 12
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate year_savings using monthly_savings and num_months
year_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Print the type of year_savings
print(type(year_savings))

# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro
doubleintro = intro + intro

# Print out doubleintro
print(doubleintro)
